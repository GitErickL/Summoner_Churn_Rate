If a summoner has some sort of pattern in session separations, say for example they play every day around the same time, then there will be many points with a $t$ of about 24 hours. In general, if there are a frequent amount of points around a non-small value of $t$ (small values constitute games **within** a play session), then this tells us the session separation is about $t$ units of time. This is an important insight because if the session separations increase with time, this gives us a warning that the player may churn.\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "    \n",
    "- **Large absences in play time**: When plotting $t$ as a function of time, these large absences in play time are characterized by large values of $t$ with the previous point being far away on the x-axis. Analyzing points before this value will give us insight on the patterns leading up to a summoner potentially churning. This point will also give us insight on what brought the summoner back to playing, instead of completely churning.\n"
