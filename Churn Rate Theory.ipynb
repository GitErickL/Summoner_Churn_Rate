If a summoner has some sort of pattern in session separations, say for example they play every day around the same time, then there will be many points with a $\\Delta t$ of about 24 hours. In general, if there are a frequent amount of points around a non-small value of $\\Delta t$ (small values constitute games **within** a play session), then this tells us the session separation is about $\\Delta t$ units of time. This is an important insight because if the session separations increase with time, this gives us a warning that the player may churn.\n",

    "    \n",
    "- **Large absences in play time**: When plotting $\\Delta t$ as a function of time, these large absences in play time are characterized by large values of $\\Delta t$ with the previous point being far away on the x-axis. Analyzing points before this value will give us insight on the patterns leading up to a summoner potentially churning. This point will also give us insight on what brought the summoner back to playing, instead of completely churning.\n"

It takes awhile to fetch game data using Riot's API, and if we wish to get data for a large amount ($>10^3$) of players' play times (~$10^3$), then this is about $10^6$ requests we need to make to Riot's API. The choice of numbers of players and games is semi-arbitrary; I just want a large enough sample size where I can make reasonable inferences about the population.\n",
